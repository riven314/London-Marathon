###How to Open Run my Program?
_You could either download the script ShinyApp(Marathon).R or_

_The following libraries is required for the RMarkdown Report:_
_library(dplyr)_
_library(ggplot2)_
_library(reshape2)_
_library(plotly)_

_The following libraries is required for the ShinyApp:_
_library(shinydashboard)_
_library(shiny)_
_library(dplyr)_
_library(ggplot2)_
_library(reshape2)_

RMarkdown Report is the updated version of my project. So there are some differences between the findings in Shiny and findings in RMarkdown Report.

###Focus

1. Does demographic characters such as age and gender to their performance? 

2. Winning at the Start Line = Win at the Goal? 

3. Anything else differentiating a good runner from a bad one?
